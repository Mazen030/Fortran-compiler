# Fortran Compiler
In a Fortran compiler, the scanner and parser are essential components of the front-end, responsible for converting the source code into an internal representation that can be further processed by subsequent stages of the compiler.<br>
## Scanner
The scanner, also known as the lexer, is the initial component of the compiler's front-end.
Its primary function is to read the source code character by character and group them into tokens.
Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in the programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.
The scanner identifies these tokens based on predefined rules specified in the language's lexical grammar.
It typically removes comments and whitespace characters, as they are usually not relevant for further processing.
The output of the scanner is a stream of tokens, which are then passed to the parser for syntactic analysis.<br>
## Parser
The parser takes the stream of tokens generated by the scanner and analyzes their syntactic structure according to the rules of the language's grammar.
It verifies whether the arrangement of tokens conforms to the syntactic rules defined by the language.
The parser builds a hierarchical structure called the parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST), representing the syntactic structure of the source code.
The AST serves as an intermediate representation of the program's structure, facilitating subsequent analysis and transformations.
If the source code contains syntax errors, the parser detects and reports them, often providing detailed error messages to aid the programmer in identifying and correcting the issues.
Depending on the compiler's design, the parser may also perform some initial semantic analysis, such as type checking or name resolution, before passing the AST to subsequent stages of the compiler.
